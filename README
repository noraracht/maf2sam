This is a simple Python script designed to covert from the MIRA
Assembly Format (MAF) to Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) format.

MAF: http://mira-assembler.sourceforge.net/docs/chap_maf_part.html
SAM: http://samtools.sourceforge.net/

This Python script served as an interim converter for MAF files from
up to MIRA v3.4 into the popular SAM/BAM assembly/mapping format.
The script was first publicly released on 30 September 2010 on the
MIRA project's mailing list:

http://www.freelists.org/post/mira_talk/Paired-end-info-SAMBAM-output-from-MIRA,13

Please note that the MIRA v3.9.x development releases leading to MIRA v4
have native support for SAM output via the included convert_project tool,
so this maf2sam.py script will become obsolete. However, it has been
updated to handle the revised MAF files from MIRA v3.9 and 4.0 as well.

The source code repository for this script is here:

The script requires Biopython to be installed, see http://biopython.org
